                        <h2>The Team</h2>                
                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/teamhack.jpg" alt="" /></span> The team was comprised of <b>multidisplinary</b> profiles including data and computer science, physics and clinal profiles. We were <b>Oriol Aranda</b> (UPC), <b>David Pujol</b> (UPC), <b>Sergi del Río</b> (UB), <b>Lucía Chacón</b> (UB) and <b>myself</b> . </p>
                        <p> It was a great opportunity to meet people with different backgrounds inside and outside the team.  
                            Oriol and David had a <b>computer engineering</b> background and were the code developers. Lucía and myself had a <b>biomedical engineering</b> background that fits perfectly with
                            the clinical profile. That role demanded to organise and annotate the material, evaluating the outputs and advising in the overall design. Finally, Sergi with a physics background and 
                            a lot of interest in <b>data science</b> supported the design work.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h2>The Challenge: RareBot</h2>
                        <p>The purpose of this project was building a smart <b>chat bot capable</b> for providing answers to rare diseases patients' relatives.
                            The chat bot aims to parents of children suffering from <b>paediatric melanoma</b>, an ultra-rare condition with an extremely low prevalence that differs
                            significantly from the adult disease.  
                        </p>
                        <p>At the discovery phase, Lucía and I conducted interviews in order to get a better understanding of the real problem. There was a <b>real need</b>
                            to find a solution to the limited access to reliable medical information. Sometimes, families were learning from forums or other non-scientific sources of
                            information. We decided to create a <b>database</b> with <b>reliable</b> and <b>well-organized</b> information. We also consider the necessity to know the nearest specialized hospital,
                            in emergency situations. 
                        </p>
                        <p> Our team decided to build a chatbot for <b>Telegram</b> programming in <b>Python</b> and named it RareBot. The code implemented <b>machine learning</b> tools and <b>multilanguage capability</b> so the user can interact in any language.
                            Other features added to our proposal were the correction of words during the interaction and the inclusion of various questions for the <b>validation</b> of the correct <b>type of
                            melanoma</b>. The last one was done prior displaying the information in response to the questions. Our chatbot also considered the <b>concurrence of multiple users </b>simultaneously.
                            Finally, the RareBot provided to the users the closest certified center according to their <b>geolocation</b>.</p>
