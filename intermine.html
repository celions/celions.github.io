                        <h2>The Internship</h2>                
                        <p>
                            It was the end of January 2020 when I got to know about the <a href="http://intermine.org/"><b>InterMine</b></a> project.
                            I found it interesting by the first moment. I was studying the third year of my Bsc in Biomedical 
                            Engineering and I had heard about the impact of <b>bioinformatics</b> research. Applying for a position as 
                            an intern was my first experience with <b>open source</b>. We are used to work with free software, 
                            so the idea of being at the other side contributing back into an open-source project was very appealing. During the internship, I have
                            incorporated all the necessary functions to the core of the <a href = "https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/InterMineR.html">InterMineR</a> 
                            to make it easier for users to work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-KYY-crgaY">list</a> objects. Recently, my work 
                            on the list manager has been merged and released to the <b>Bioconductor</b> version of <b>InterMineR</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I appreciated the warm welcome into the community, introduced enthusiastically by <b>Yo Yehudi</b> with lovely meetings with the rest of interns each week. Those 
                            made working remotely less hard. I had previously worked with R and Shiny and I was comfortable with them. However, the work during the summer months, that 
                            has been extended until the begining of 2021, has been very demmanding. I am very grateful to <b>Rachel Lyne</b>, being there and <b>guiding</b> me during the internship, but 
                            also for her invaluable help in my final degree project writing. I cannot fail in my remarks to express appreciation for the coworking with <b>Daniela Butano</b> and 
                            <b>Adrián Bazaga</b>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Altogether, the guidance, the meetings, the project results and the level of <b>satisfaction</b> with them make me be
                            looking towards joining other big projects!

                        <h2>InterMineR Cytoscape Interface</h2>
                        <p><a href="https://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a> is the most preferred tool for <b>biological graph analysis</b>. Networks provide a good way to
                            visualise large biological datasets. Although InterMineR and Cytoscape were perfectly functional separately, the lack of a user interface between them was making tedious to use 
                            them together. InterMineR Cytoscape Interface is the first version of this <b>Shiny</b> application. The first requierements for the user interface were to make possible to <b>run queries</b>
                            with InterMineR and then visualise the results with <b>Cytoscape node/edge graph-based visualisations</b>. Those requierements have been satisfied. Many more functionalities such as 
                            continuous mapping with size and colour gradients, have been incorporated. 
                        </p>  
                        <p>
